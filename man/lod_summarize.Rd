\title{Given LOD scores at markers for a single gene and that gene's annotation,
this function extracts the maximum LOD score, and also determines the
LOD score for cis, distal, and trans associations.}
\usage{
lod_summarize(lod_scores_mod, annot_info, cis_window = 1e+07)
}
\arguments{
\item{lod_scores_mod}{A tibble with LOD results. Must contain columns: `id`, `chr`, `pos`, and `lod`.}

\item{annot_info}{A list or named vector with gene information. Must contain `chr` and `start`.}

\item{cis_window}{The cis region size in base pairs (default: 10 Mb).}
}
\value{
A named `list` with the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item max_lod - Maximum LOD score overall
  \item max_marker - Marker ID corresponding to max LOD
  \item cis_lod - Max LOD score within cis window
  \item cis_marker - Marker ID for cis LOD
  \item distal_lod - Max LOD score on same chromosome outside cis
  \item distal_marker - Marker ID for distal LOD
  \item trans_lod - Max LOD score on other chromosomes
  \item trans_marker - Marker ID for trans LOD
}
}
\description{
If no markers fall within the cis window, the nearest marker on the same
chromosome is used as a proxy for cis.
